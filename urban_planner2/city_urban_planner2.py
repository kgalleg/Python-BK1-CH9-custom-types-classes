# Practice: Urban Planner II
# Setup
# cd ~/workspace/python/exercises/planner
# touch main.py city.py
# In the previous Urban Planner exercise, you practices defining custom types to represent buildings. Now you need to create a type to represent your city. Here are the requirements for the class. You define the properties and methods.

# Name of the city.
# The mayor of the city.
# Year the city was established.
# A collection of all of the buildings in the city.
# A method to add a building to the city.
# Remember, each class should be in its own file. Define the City class in the city.py file.


class City:

    def __init__(self, name, mayor, year_established):
        # Establish the properties of each building
        # with a default value
        self.name = name
        self.mayor = mayor
        self.year_established = year_established
        self.buildings = []


    def add_building (self, building):
        self.buildings.append(building)
